# What is React Native?

React Native is a popular open-source framework developed by Facebook for building mobile applications using JavaScript (or TypeScript) and React. It enables developers to build native mobile apps for iOS and Android platforms using a single codebase, which significantly speeds up development without compromising on the performance and usability of the apps.

With React Native, you write components with JSX, a syntax that combines JavaScript and XML. These components can map to native UI elements like views, text, images, and more.

For more in-depth information about React Native, I recommend visiting the [official documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started).

# Why React Native?

- React Native is a widely popular framework for building native mobile applications using JavaScript (or TypeScript) and React. There are plenty of reasons why you would want to choose React Native for your next mobile app development project:
- Code Reusability: React Native allows you to share a significant amount of your codebase between iOS and Android platforms. This not only reduces the development time but also makes it easier to maintain the app.
- Familiar React Concepts: If you’re already familiar with ReactJS, React Native will feel right at home for you. Since it’s based on React, the same principles of components and state management apply in React Native too.
- Native Performance: React Native apps deliver near-native performance as the framework works directly with native components like Views and Text, thus eliminating the need for WebView or other similar intermediaries.
- Vast Ecosystem: React Native enjoys a huge community and vast ecosystem that includes a wide range of libraries and tools that simplify and accelerate the development process. Additionally, Facebook and other major companies actively contribute to the growth and improvement of React Native.
- Hot Reloading: React Native supports hot-reloading, which means you can see the changes you make in your code directly on the device/emulator without having to recompile or rebuild the app entirely. This makes for a faster and more efficient development process.
- Integration with Existing Apps: Can be incorporated into existing mobile applications, providing flexibility to extend only parts of an app.

# React Native Alternatives

React Native is a popular choice for cross-platform application development, but there are other options available. Some of the common alternatives to React Native are Flutter, Ionic and Xamarin. Flutter being the most popular alternative to React Native.

# Environment Setup

In React Native, setting up the development environment is a crucial step. The environment setup process includes installing and configuring various tools and packages required for developing, building, and launching a React Native application. There are two main approaches when setting up your React Native development environment:

#### Expo CLI

Expo CLI is a command-line tool built for creating and managing React Native projects easily. It streamlines your development process by providing an entire development environment, including building and deploying your app to both iOS and Android platforms.

Visit the [Expo CLI Quickstart](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project) page for detailed instructions on how to set up your environment.

#### React Native CLI

React Native CLI is the official command-line interface for building native mobile apps using React Native. This method requires you to manually set up the native development environment and tools needed for iOS and Android app development.

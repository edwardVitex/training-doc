# React Native Intern Level

## Learn the Pre-requisites

Before you start learning React Native, you should have a basic knowledge of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [React](https://react.dev/learnhttps://roadmap.sh/reac). You don’t need to fully master these topics, but you should be familiar with them

### JavaScript and TypeScript Basics

There’s a lot more to learn in JavaScript/TypeScript but my recommendation is to learn the basics and then learn as you go. You’ll learn a lot more by building things than by reading about them.

- [JavaScript (ES6+) Fundamentals](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-es6/)
- [TypeScript Basics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)

### React Fundamentals

React Native uses React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. You should have a basic understanding of React concepts before proceeding with React Native. Some of the concepts you should be familiar with include:

- [React Component](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component)
- [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx)
- [State](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state)
- [Props](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component)

### React Native Basics

Learn core React Native components and styling.
Core components are the essential building blocks provided by React Native to create a user interface for mobile applications. They are platform-agnostic, meaning they work across both iOS and Android devices. Some of the common core components include:

- [View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view)
- [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text)
- [Text Input](https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput)
- [Button](https://reactnative.dev/docs/button)
- [Image](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image)
- [Switch](https://reactnative.dev/docs/switch)
- [Modal](https://reactnative.dev/docs/modal)
- [Pressable](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable)
- [Scroll View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview)
- [FlatList](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist)

Layout is done with [Flexbox styles](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox)

### Version Control (Git) Basics

Git is “an open-source version control system that tracks code changes over time”. Using Git allows collaboration and tracking work

### Basic RESTful APIs and Data Fetching

Learn how to make HTTP requests to consume APIs (e.g. REST endpoints returning JSON)

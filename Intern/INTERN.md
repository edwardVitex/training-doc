# React Native Intern Level

## Learn the Pre-requisites

Before you start learning React Native, you should have a basic knowledge of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [React](https://react.dev/learnhttps://roadmap.sh/reac). You don’t need to fully master these topics, but you should be familiar with them

#### JavaScript and TypeScript Basics

There’s a lot more to learn in JavaScript/TypeScript but my recommendation is to learn the basics and then learn as you go. You’ll learn a lot more by building things than by reading about them.

-   [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)

#### React Basics

React Native uses React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. You should have a basic understanding of React concepts before proceeding with React Native. Some of the concepts you should be familiar with include:

-   [React Component](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component)
-   [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx)
-   [State](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state)
-   [Props](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component)
-   [React Hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks)

## React Native Core Components

Core components are the essential building blocks provided by React Native to create a user interface for mobile applications. They are platform-agnostic, meaning they work across both iOS and Android devices. Some of the common core components include:

-   [View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view)
-   [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text)

-   [Text Input](https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput)
-   [Button](https://reactnative.dev/docs/button)

-   [Image](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image)
-   [Switch](https://reactnative.dev/docs/switch)

-   [Modal](https://reactnative.dev/docs/modal)
-   [Pressable](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable)

-   [Scroll View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview)
-   [FlatList](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist)
